# permory
Permory was developed in 2010 as an algorithm to perform efficient permutation tests for large-scale genetic data sets.

It was published along with a research article, which can be found at https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/26/17/2093/199718
By now, the algorithm has been adapted and re-implemented in the open source PLINK software project (https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink).

As a result, this repository is not under any further development at this point.
