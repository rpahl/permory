Message Passing Interface (MPI)
-------------------------------

PERMORY is using Boost MPI (http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/mpi.html)
and was tested with Open MPI (http://www.open-mpi.org/).

MPI allows you to spawn multiple processes of PERMORY. These processes will
divide the calculation and work parallelly.

To run PERMORY with MPI just pass the command line to run PERMORY (see
QUICKSTART.txt) to mpirun. The usage is:
    $ mpirun [mpi_options] permory [option] <data_file1> [data_file2 ...]

You may consult the documentation of your MPI implementation for options to pass
to mpirun.


Requirements
------------
Each instance of PERMORY needs access to the data files. If a configuration
file is used, each instance needs access to the configuration file, too.
If there is no file-system which is available to each node it is necessary to
copy all needed files to each single node before starting PERMORY.
If there is a global file-system available to each node check if the data
throughput is sufficient to concurrently serve all nodes running PERMORY.
You can use compressed data files to lower the raw I/O data throughput.


Example 1
---------
To calculate 120000 permutations in six MPI processes of PERMORY use the
following command:

$ mpirun -np 6 permory -n 120000 -f data/tiny.tfam data/tiny.tped

Each of the six processes will calculate 20000 permutations. Eventually all
processes will send their individual results to the process with id 0 which
will print out the result.


Example 2
---------
Simple example script "permory_mpi.sh" to use with Oracle Grid Engine (former
Sun Grid Engine):

    #!/bin/sh
    mpirun -np $NSLOTS -machinefile $TMPDIR/machines ./permory -c some.conf

To submit this script into a queue "parallel@@nodes_ng" using Open MPI run the
following command:

$ qsub -cwd -l h_rt=1:0:0 -pe orte 10 -q parallel@@nodes_ng -R y permory_mpi.sh

This will queue the script "permory_mpi.sh" requesting 10 nodes for MPI usage.


Example 3
---------
To take advantage of multiple CPUs and cores per node you can tell mpirun
(version 1.3+) to spawn multiple processes on one node.

$ mpirun -npernode 2 -H hosta,hostb ./permory -c some.conf

This command will run four instances of PERMORY: Two on node "hosta" and two on
node "hostb".
