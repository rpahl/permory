Changes in 1.1.1 (2014-03-26)
-----------------------------

Bugfixes:
- In result file out.all, p-values were not correctly displayed if test 
  statistics for some markers were not defined. This has been corrected and
    non-tested markers are now dislayed in the out.all file with "NA"-values
    along the lines of PLINK output.

- Fixed format detection bug, which occured with *.tfam files, starting with 
  ID numbers greater than 9, in which case Permory wrongly assumed the file
  format 'compact'.


General:
- Deprecated file format 'compact' for phenotype data
