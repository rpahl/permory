- revise enums.hpp as done in groupseq++ project
- maybe provide more tests, and if so
	1) provide robust test statistics
	2)add to docu: "Don't use allelic test on *.tped data as plink reorders alleles when transposing the filesets using --transpose."
- MRU list using boost::serialization (see Example 9 in boost::MultiIndex)
