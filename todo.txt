- compute and display single-marker adjusted p-values (just using the permutations)
- for case-control sample provide MAF estimated separately from cases and controls, resp.
- ommit Parameter class and instead solely use variables map of boost program options lib
- improve result printing (e.g. general printer class where columns to print can be added successively, probably using function overloading for different types of data, e.g.: add(string colname, std::deque<double>), add(string colname, std::deque<string>) and so on ...)
- revise enums.hpp as done in groupseq++ project
- handle missing values in phenotype data (so far throws !!!Error: bad lexical cast: source type value could not be interpreted as target)
- improve format detection (maybe protect against some format issues such as having Macintosh line endings (^M), i.e. at least give some message if there was only read one single (long) line
- provide robust test statistics
- MRU list using boost::serialization (see Example 9 in boost::MultiIndex)
